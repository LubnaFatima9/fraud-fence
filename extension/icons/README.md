# Icon Placeholders

This folder should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- **icon32.png** - 32x32 pixels (Windows taskbar)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Style
- Use a shield or security-themed icon
- Primary colors should match your brand (consider #667eea from your website)
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Make it recognizable at small sizes

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Color depth**: 32-bit (RGBA)
- **Background**: Transparent preferred
- **Sharp edges**: Avoid anti-aliasing issues at small sizes

### Icon Suggestions
1. **Shield with checkmark** - Represents protection and verification
2. **Magnifying glass with warning sign** - Represents detection and analysis
3. **Lock with security badge** - Represents security and trust
4. **Eye with warning triangle** - Represents vigilance and threat detection

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- **Canva** - Use their icon templates
- **Figma** - Design custom icons
- **Adobe Illustrator** - Professional vector design
- **GIMP** - Free alternative
- **Online generators** - Search for "chrome extension icon generator"

## Temporary Solution

Until you create custom icons, you can:
1. Use generic shield/security icons from free icon libraries
2. Convert your website favicon to different sizes
3. Use placeholder colored squares with text

## Installation Note

The extension will not load properly without these icon files. Please add them before testing the extension.
