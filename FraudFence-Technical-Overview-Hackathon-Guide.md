#### Q: How do you handle different types of fraud detection (text, image, URL)?

**Answer:**
Our modular approach uses specialized AI flows:

```
src/ai/flows/
├── analyze-text-fraud.ts    // NLP + pattern recognition
├── analyze-image-fraud.ts   // Computer vision + OCR
└── analyze-url-fraud.ts     // Domain analysis + threat intelligence
```

**Text Analysis Flow:**

- **Client-side processing**: Browser extension processes basic analysis locally when possible
- **HTTPS everywhere**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **No user tracking**: No personal identifiers, cookies, or behavioral tracking
- **Minimal data transfer**: Only necessary content sent to AI models, not full documents
- **Privacy by design**: System architected to minimize data exposure from the ground up
- **Local storage only**: User feedback stored locally in browser, not on servers

#### Q: What measures prevent abuse of your fraud detection system?

**Answer:**
- **Rate limiting**: API endpoints have request limits (100 requests/hour for free tier)
- **Input validation**: Zod schemas validate all inputs with strict type checking
- **Content filtering**: Size limits on images (10MB), text (50KB), URL validation
- **CORS policies**: Restricted to authorized domains and origins
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation without exposing internal system details
- **Authentication**: API key requirements for high-volume usage
- **Monitoring**: Real-time abuse detection and automatic blocking

### 3. Scalability & Performance Questions

#### Q: How would you scale this system for millions of users?

**Answer:**

**Current Architecture:**
```
Frontend → API Routes → AI Models → Response
```

**Scaled Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Frontend  │────│  API Queue  │────│  AI Workers │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
                            │
                   ┌─────────────┐
                   │   Results   │
                   │   Cache     │
                   └─────────────┘
```

**Scaling Strategy:**

**Answer:**
- **Real-time protection**: Analyze content while browsing without context switching
- **Context integration**: Right-click analysis on any selected text, image, or link
- **Seamless UX**: No need to copy-paste content between applications
- **Proactive security**: Intercept and analyze before user interaction with suspicious content
- **Offline capability**: Basic pattern matching works without internet connection
- **Universal compatibility**: Works on any website regardless of their security measures
- **Privacy**: Local processing reduces data transmission

#### Q: How does your extension handle different websites and content types?

**Answer:**
```javascript
// Manifest V3 service worker approach
chrome.contextMenus.create({
  id: "analyzeText",
  title: "🛡️ Check for Fraud",
  contexts: ["selection", "image", "link"]
});

// Dynamic content extraction
const extractContent = (type) => {
  switch(type) {
    case 'text': return window.getSelection().toString();
    case 'image': return element.src || canvas.toDataURL();
    case 'link': return element.href;
  }
};
```

**Cross-site compatibility:**
- Content script injection for DOM access
- Secure message passing between contexts
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
